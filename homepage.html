  <p>Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance style that originated hundreds of years ago. Originally meant for religious story telling exclusively in temples around India, Bharatanatyam eventually became a well-known dance genre all around the world. For many years now, it has graced audiences in theaters, movies, festivals, TV shows, and the Internet. Though not a master of Bharatanatyam myself, I came to understand the command and discipline needed to become a Bharatanatyam dancer when I was a performer for an Indian-fusion dance company years ago. Dancing with me back then were two lively and warmhearted sisters who always amazed me with their artistry, both in dance and in other art forms. Their names are Anjali and Geatali Tampy. This past year they invited me to their Arangetram, their Bharatanatyam performance debut.</p>
